    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


With the objective of having our business customers served by the best team to support their needs, we have recently reviewed our RH Contract and RH Trade account membership.


Our RH Contract division is focused on large architecture and design firms, developers, distributors, professional contractors and ownership groups working predominantly in the Hospitality, Commercial and Residential Building segments.


Our RH Trade division is focused on Residential interior designers, stagers, architects and professional contractors working directly with homeowners on their individual residential design and home improvement projects.


From our research, it seems that your business has a focus in each of these areas. On this basis, we have created a second account so that you may shop as either a Trade or Contract customer. Your new Account# is {!Account.X12_Digit_Member__c}.


We&apos;re looking forward to providing improved support for your business and clients.


Kind regards,

RH</textOnly>
