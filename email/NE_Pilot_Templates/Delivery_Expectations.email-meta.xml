    <subject>What to expect regarding delivery of your Order {!Opportunity.Order_Number__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your payment!

Your order number is {!Opportunity.Order_Number__c}.

In-stock UPS items generally begin to ship within two business days. Tracking information will typically arrive via email 2-3 days after shipments have left our Distribution Center.

For furniture delivery, our local delivery hub will call you to schedule your appointment.  You can expect this call approximately one week after the item has shipped. Please allow 2 weeks for non-metropolitan areas. Furniture shipments do not have tracking numbers.

Note: You have a 30-day window in which to accept delivery.  Please reach out to me if you need more time, as this is by request only and you may incur a nominal warehouse storage fee.

All the best,
{!Opportunity.Ops_Contact__c}</textOnly>
